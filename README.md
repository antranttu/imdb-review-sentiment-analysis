# Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movies Review - Top 5%

A binary classification challenge on kaggle where we have to classify people's sentiments in their movie reviews. 1 or positive and 0 for negative sentiment. I used Neural Network and tried a combination of different word representations in this challenge: from simple **Bag of Words** (BoW) with binary representations and TF-IDF; to **Word Embeddings** with Stanford's GloVe.

In conclusion, the word embeddings representation outperform the BoW representation by a large margin.
